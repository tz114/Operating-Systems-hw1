# Operating-Systems-hw1

Our task was to implement a rudimentary cache of words in a given text file to practice working with pointers and dynamic allocation of memory. We were not allowed to use square brackets in our code in order to emphasize the use of pointers.

Usage: ./hw1 <cache size> <text file>
